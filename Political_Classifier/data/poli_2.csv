Italy's designate Prime Minister Carlo Cottarelli has put on hold the formation of a technocrat government as ""new possibilities"" reportedly emerged for agreement on an elected coalition.

Cottarelli raised hopes of a solution to Italy's political crisis on Wednesday, with comments that suggested a political compromise might still be possible. 

Cottarelli, who is a former International Monetary Fund \(IMF\) official, had been tasked by President Sergio Mattarella on Monday to form a caretaker government and plan renewed elections, a day after an attempt for a government by populist parties Five Star Movement and League broke down.

Their pick for prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, abandoned his mandate to form a government on Sunday after Mattarella refused to allow Paolo Savona, an outspoken critic of the EU, to take up the post of minister of economy. 

On Wednesday, Italian news agency ANSA quoted sources close to Cottarelli who said he would wait for possible developments before pressing ahead with the formation of an interim government. 

""During his work as premier designate for the formation of a new government, new possibilities emerged for the creation of a political government,"" the sources told ANSA. 

""Faced with the tension on the markets, this circumstance induced him \- in agreement with the president \- to await eventual developments.""

Five Star Movement leader Di Maio appeared willing to return to the negotiation table. 

A source close to the populist party told Reuters news agency the parties are now trying to find ""a point of compromise on another name"" for the economy ministry. 

But leader of far\-right party League, Matteo Salvini, said Italy should have elections as soon as possible. 

""The earlier we vote the better because it's the best way to get out of this quagmire and confusion,"" Reuters quoted him as saying. 

Italy has been without a government for nearly three months after the March elections came out inconclusive.

I have suffered a serious injustice from the country's highest institution on the basis of a paradoxical process of wanting to leave the euro and not to those I profess and repeated in my statement, criticized by most of the media without even explaining its contents. Along with the solidarity expressed by those who know me and do not distort my thinking, a particular consolation came to me from Jean Paul Fitoussi in the morning of Naples and Wolfgang Münchau in the Financial Times. The first, with whom I have had discussions on the subject for decades, correctly states that I would never have questioned the euro, but I would have asked the European Union to provide answers to the needs for change that come from within all member countries; I would add that this should have taken place according to the negotiating strategy suggested by the theory of the games, which recommends not revealing the limits of action, because otherwise it has already defeated, a concept that I have repeatedly expressed publicly. In the era of like or don't like also the Presidency of the Republic follows this fashion.

Münchau's comment is more incisive and close to my thoughts. In his commentary he analyses what the euro must be like in order not to suffer the world dominance of the dollar and the geopolitics of the United States, stating that the European currency was badly built because of the short\-sightedness of the Germans. Germany is preventing the euro from becoming âan essential part of foreign policyâ like the dollar. Unfortunately, he adds, the dollar has lost this characteristic, the euro is not in a position to replace it or, at the very least, to play a parallel role, and as a result we are in the chaos of international economic relations; these are heading towards nationalistic protectionism, which is certainly not conducive to political, social and economic stability. This is the theme I touched on with Paolo Panerai in the pamphlet recently published in Carli e il Trattato di Maastricht, where the lucid greatness of Paolo Baffi emerges. Italy is experiencing poverty, lower income and greater inequality. An important meeting of Heads of State will be held in Brussels on 28 and 29 June: who will represent the demands of the Italian people? Mattarella can't go there, nor can Cottarelli. If it had not had unacceptable vetoes, because they were unfounded, the Count Government could have counted on the support of Macron, thus channelling the disjointed reactions that come from within all the European member countries indiscriminately towards decisions that help Italy to get out of the way it was pushed. MrÂ MÃŒnchau is right to say that he is âfeared that there will be no political support in Northern Europeâ, and so we have no choice but to suffer the effects of protectionism and social instability. It is a question of deciding whether the pro\-Europeans are the ones who are creating the conditions for the end of the EU or who, like me, are calling for its reform in order to save the objectives that it set itself.

I am a Canadian citizen. Considering I am willing to learn the local language and plan to settle in the country for an extended period of time, what are careers that employees are sought after in the present (and future) European economy and me being a Canadian citizen would be overlooked.

I would prefer somewhere in Northwestern Europe: the UK, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Denmark,France, Sweden, Luxembourg.

So can I get a list of careers that would be considered *hot* in Northwestern Europe and that finding employment as a non-EU citizen (I'm Canadian) with the right qualifications would land me a job relatively easily, considering I learn the local language.

I'm currently a student studying Supply Chain Management, with an undergrad in Statistics.

I wrote lucrative and easy to get careers, I obviously meant with the right qualifications and experience.

https://twitter.com/MMQWalker/status/1001323251673501696?s=19

&gt;The #eurocrisis got real when Italian &amp; Spanish bond markets began unraveling in 2011-12. Capital flight had a self-fulfilling dynamic, like bank runs on countries, and no action by national govts could stop it. /1

&gt;Belgian economist @pdegrauwe had warned that such a dynamic was an unforeseen, potentially lethal flaw of the €zone - and that only the ECB had the firepower to break it, by playing bond-buyer of last resort. /2

&gt;And so it came to pass. Draghi said he’d do “whatever it takes” and markets believed him, ending the self-fulfilling dynamic and the existential phase of the #eurocrisis. /3

&gt;But Draghi only felt able to expand ECB mission in this way once he had a green light from Berlin. (Here’s how he got it despite vigorous Bundesbank opposition: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443507204578020323544183926 …) /4

&gt;To earn German &amp; ECB support, Italy &amp; Spain had to show they were serious about fiscal retrenchment &amp; other overhauls. Merkel - and therefore Draghi - can only justify backstopping governments that play by the rules, incl. on deficits. Otherwise too much moral hazard. /5

&gt;(In Greece, Syriza failed to learn this lesson, so it was taught to them again in 2015.) /6

&gt;Thus in 2011 Berlusconi had to go as Italian PM, and technocrat successor Monti had to show Italy was taking bitter medicine. Ultimately it was all about persuading Merkel to let Draghi unleash the ECB. /7

&gt;Problem: Monti’s austerity measures (mainly tax hikes) deepened Italy’s slump. Italy still hasn’t recovered from its double-dip recession during the crisis. /8

&gt;And many Italian voters blame the economic scars since 2011 on austerity, Germany, EU institutions &amp; financial markets. /9

&gt;So the argument for fiscal and rhetorical restraint, made by Italy’s deeply unpopular establishment, is more likely to anger than to persuade voters who see it as subservience to Berlin, Brussels, Frankfurt and “lo spread.” /10

&gt;Lega &amp; M5S have no serious plan to leave the €. (You can’t. Not without burning your country down.) But they sense they can now slaughter the feeble establishment in snap elections by painting them as stooges of the nasty Germans. /11

&gt;When Lega/M5S finally get into govt, I do not know whether they will walk the talk. How radically they will break with European fiscal rules in reality? How much is posturing? /12

&gt;How much risk will they take for domestic political gain? Do they fully understand the risks? Or are they self-deluding like Syriza in 2015? /13

&gt;But if they govern as they’re currently talking, then they will be acting without an ECB safety net. /14

&gt;And if debt investors think the safety net is gone, then the unstable Draghi-Monti-Merkel #eurocrisis settlement of 2012 will be history. /end of thread &amp; possibly Europe as we know it

But I'm not an economist, or diplomat, so there's one pressing question I cannot find an answer to. And before I get lectured, I realize that this is controversial, and that it hasn't happened yet, and that we are likely still far from this happening. However, the situation in Italy makes me again fear redenomination risks.

In the event of a country (Italy, Greece, Portugal, etc.) suddenly redenominating their debts and banking system in a national currency (thus leaving the euro), how would this process likely play out in practice?

Specifically, how would we suppose the current euro reserves in both the private and public accounts would be replaced? Obviously, an immediate exchange rate would be selected, and the new currency would be digitally ""printed"" into the accounts in the both private (banking and otherwise), and public (state treasury) accounts, as the logistics of moving paper money into ATMs and vaults would be handled along the way. But what the hell happens to the physical euros that were ""replaced."" Ideally, they'd be removed from circulation, but in the event of this crisis, what would prevent the country from storing these physical reserves (collected from the banks previous reserve requirements) in a separate account to pay down it's own debt or use to (attempt to) stabilize their exchange rate, and simply allowing implicit defaults in all other private cases as was inevitable anyway?

Could there be inflation with respect to the eurozone, not just the newly introduced currency? We are talking about billions of euros replaced and essentially reduplicated into the money supply.

Follow up, if a contagion event causes this to happen elsewhere as more countries abandon the euro, would massive euro inflation also occur from international holders dumping the currency? The euro is a major global reserve currency (accounting for at least 23% of foreign reserves). So if one country (I'm concerned about Italy at the moment) leaves the euro, could that force the immediate dissolution of the currency or else face price instability? 

What is the greatest factor determining the moves of the euro's values? The inflation caused by redenomination or the deflation caused by financial crises due to the implicit defaults? This is a money supply question.

I'm not asking for the implications of the process. I understand that this would be a horrific disaster, I don't want this to happen, obviously. I know, it would be an implicit default if you pay back private debts in devalued currency, and the new currency would rapidly depreciate, access to foreign capital would halt, and political backlash from both eurozone and EU members would debate whether this constitutes automatic expulsion from the EU (which nobody would want to add trade barriers to the crisis so it likely wouldn't happen and just be talk) and/or legal or trade action to punish the country for defaulting on it's debt obligations.

What historical examples (if any) exist? How is this unique event covered in international law? And if the euro falls out of use in all countries, then how could euro-denominated debt be calculated between nations at all? There would be no fixed exchange rate mechanism, so no agreement would exist for determining what the ""final"" euro value was relative to the new currencies in order to calculate a rate. Could this debt ever be resolved? Or would debtor countries have no incentive to negotiate this, leaving creditor country institutions with a likely financial crisis?

I'm a solo traveler from Canada and I think the most important things to me when travelling are the atmosphere, history and architecture within each city. I love to get the unique feeling of varying cities within a country. For the trip I spend a few days in Budapest and leave on Aug. 10. Come the 11th I'll be in my first city in Romania. I was thinking of taking a train all day from Budapest to Sighisoara or Sibiu on the 10th . Although a night train would be better for the night of the 10th (I can't seem to find any nights trains to Sighisoara), plus if I did a night train I'd be able to see Budapest a little longer and save time. I have a Eurail Global pass but the bus also seems like a good idea from Budapest to Romania. I'm still not sure whether I'd prefer Sibiu or Sighisoara but understand that I'd be able to do Sighisoara in a day at least instead of missing large parts of Sibiu if I'm there only one day. The morning of the 12th I'd travel to Brasov and spend the 13th and 14th there as well. In Brasov I'd like to spend a day or half day in Sinaia as well, I could even spend a night there if I wanted to. The morning of the 15th I'd leave for Bucharest, spend the 16th there and fly to Istanbul on the 17th. 
August 10 - Travel 
11 - Sighisoara/Sibiu or other recommended city 
12 - Brasov 
13 - Brasov 
14 - Brasov 
15 - Bucharest 
16 - Bucharest 

I think really I'm just asking for advice on getting to Romania from Budapest and asking for suggestions and critique on my itinerary. Thanks, greatly looking forward to visiting Romania.",europe,t5_2qh4j,6 days in romania travel advice,9

I'm sure you have seen a lot of headlines about failure in creating the government in Italy.

But how did we arrive at this point? And what will happen next?

I'll try to answer these two questions giving facts. As human being, I am biased, but I try to keep my considerations outside this post. _Full disclosure: I am an Italian living in Germany, and fully integrated. Due this, I am pro-EU. Only personal consequences to me for what happens in Italy are the consequences having impact on the EU._

### How the government works in Italy

Italy is a parliamentary republic with two houses, Camera and Senato. Differences between the two are out of the scope of this post. They have legislative power.

Executive power is exercised by the Council of Ministry, led by the Prime Minister.

Head of the State is the President.

One of the duties of the President is appointing the Prime Minister and the Council. Since they have to work with the houses, usually the majority of the houses suggest a Prime Minister, and he suggests the Council. The President then appoint them. After they have been appointed, the houses need to confirm them with a vote. Please note that the President can appoint whoever he wants (while he usually doesn't, for obvious reasons).

More information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Italy

### What happened in last 3 months.

Beginning of March general elections were held in Italy, and no clear majority came out.
After more or less a month of consultations, two parties (Lega and 5 Stars Movement) found an agreement. They wrote a ""contract"" with their plan for next months / years, and they submitted to their voters (as SPD did in Germany 3 months ago).

Voters approved the contract, so Lega and 5 Stars suggested a Prime Minister, Conte. Opposition was noisy about this name, because it was the first time it appeared in public discussions on Italy, and for a [strange story](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/italy-giuseppe-conte-cv-new-york-university) about his CV. Anyhow, the President gave Conte order to suggest names for the Council. Conte, of course, talked with Lega and 5 Stars to create the Council, and after other long discussions, proposed a list of names.

So far, business as usual.

Now things are getting interesting: the President vetoed the proposed Minister of Economy (Savona), because anti euro.

[Literally](https://www.ilpost.it/2018/05/27/il-testo-integrale-del-discorso-di-sergio-mattarella-sul-fallito-governo-lega-m5s/) (my translation):

&gt; Ho chiesto, per quel ministero [...] un esponente che [...] non sia visto come sostenitore di una linea, più volte manifestata, che potrebbe provocare, probabilmente, o, addirittura, inevitabilmente, la fuoruscita dell’Italia dall’euro. 

&gt; I've asked for the (Economy) ministry [...] someone [...] who is not seen as supporter of a line, which he already manifested, that would probably, or maybe/better, will inexorably, provoke the exit of Italy from the Eurozone

He suggested other names: among them, Giorgetti, from the Lega. Lega and 5 Stars vetoed all of them and therefore Conte resigned, because they haven't found an agreement.

The President spoke to the nation before dinner, saying that he tried everything to create the government, while 5 Stars and Lega are going giving all the fault to the President.

### What's next

The President has asked a new person, [Carlo Cottarelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Cottarelli), to be Prime Minster and to propose a Council. He should probably create a ""neutral"" government (so with more or less the support of every party in the houses) - it's not clear yet what would be its goal (do some business and having new elections, or being PM for 5 years).

Edit 6:  
He was supposed to present his list of ministers on the 29th, but after meeting the President in the afternoon, he says presentation is delayed to the 30th of May. Rumours are, due 5 Stars and Lega pressure, elections will be held in July.

The real questions is: will houses support Cottarelli? Probably not, because both Lega and 5 Stars describe themself as anti-establishment, while Cottarelli would be seen as ""politics as usual"".

Edits 1, 5, and 6:  
- ~~5 Stars wants to impeach the President due violation of the constitution.~~ They retreated on the 29th
- Lega is asking for new elections

Edit 2:
New elections with the same electoral law could have slightly different results, because Berlusconi has been rehabilitated last month: he didn't run in last elections (while his party had), so he would probably be able to catch some other votes. You can see [trends here](http://www.youtrend.it/2010/03/11/tabella-riepilogo-sondaggi-politici-elettorali/). If you scroll to first graph, blue is actual situation, red is election, green is difference. Lega had +5.5%, and with its coalition has more than 39%. 40% is necessary to have the majority.

### Why Italy needs a government NOW

Other than the usual tasks of a government, and the issues in not having one, Italy has a very big problem ahead. Long story short: back in 2011, Berlusconi's government legally bound Italy to an agreement that if some goals were not reach, the VAT would increase.

At the moment, VAT in Italy is 22%. From the 1st of Jan 2019, it will be 24.2%, unless a financial agreement finds 12 billions of euros - without government, such agreement is impossible. Inactivity on the matter will increase the VAT automatically.

After that, VAT will be 24.9% in 2020, and 25% in 2021.

As comparison, after Greek Austerity Package, VAT in Greece is 24%.

Good luck Italy.

*Edit 1*: added last declarations by 5 Stars and Lega. For sake of brevity and clarity, I used ""Lega"" also for ""Lega secretary"", Matteo Salvini, since he is the official voice of the party  
*Edit 2*: added some trends for next elections  
*Edit 3*: rephrased sentence on VAT to be clearer  
*Edit 4*: VAT in Greece is 24%, not 23%, thanks u/iz_no_good  
*Edit 5*: Savona is anti-euro, not anti-EU, thanks u/kosky95. Also rephrasing on M5S asking for impeachment

I'm an EU citizen but grew up in latin america. I have a certification for up to 9th grade, and unfortunately had to drop out of high school because of very serious family issues. Then I came back to Europe some 5 years ago. However I do NOT have a copy of any school leaving certification, (not even 9th grade or my partial High School Certificate), because we (my mom and I) had to return to Europe in a VERY short notice (from not even an idea to being on the plane it was 3 days. I wont detail too much but our embassy paid for our tickets and helped us return because of abusive family situation of my mom with his partner who we were economically dependent on there).  
 
Anyway, now I am 23 years old, and I work as a software developer with 6 months of experience now. Before that I have 20 months experience as Operations level IT support and before that 2 years I worked in a call center. So I don't really *need* a diploma that much anymore as I already work in the industry I like, however in the long term I would like to specialize in something like Machine Learning or Data Science which require very strong foundations in math which I lack (I know up to single variable calculus and a bit of linear algebra, but it's all self taught, I'm not sure how much I dont know, and more advanced resources are very hard to come by, while specialized books seem completely alien to me). 
 
For now the ONLY assured option I see is studying in the Open University (from UK) which does not have any entry requeriments but it's very expensive and for what I've researched by SOME people it's taken as a second class degree and also it's not sure that universities in europe accept the BSc for entry requeriment to a degree. 
 
The other option I see is the University of London International Programme which is also distance learning (which is good because I need to work to sustain myself), which is also considerably cheaper but their entry requeriments are standard. 
 
Do I have a chance of being accepted to the U of London? or would it be a waste of 100 GBP to pay for the registration fee? I understand that I dont have literally any kind of paper qualifications however I've been working in IT for 2 and a half years without any kind of issue... 
 
Any kind of advice would be appreciated. ",europe,t5_2qh4j,study a bsc in europe without any previous school certificate / qualification?,5

After having experimented, in the first two months, without success, all possible solutions, it became clear - as is known - a parliamentary majority between the Cinque Stelle Movement and the League which, despite being opposed to the elections, reached an agreement, after a wide programmatic work.

In any case, I have facilitated the attempt to give life to a government.

I waited for the time required by them to reach a program agreement and to have it approved by the respective bases of militants, while aware that this would have attracted critical remarks.

I accepted the proposal for the office of Prime Minister, overcoming every perplexity on the fact that a political government was led by an unelected president in Parliament. And I have accompanied it, with full attention, the work to form the government.

No one can, therefore, argue that I have hindered the formation of the government that is called change. On the contrary, I have accompanied this attempt with great collaboration; as is my duty in the presence of a parliamentary majority; in compliance with the rules of the Constitution.

I had pointed out, both to the representatives of the two parties, and to the president in charge, without receiving objections, that, for some ministries, I would have given particularly high attention to the choices to be made.

This afternoon Professor Conte - whom I appreciate and thank - presented me with his proposals for the decrees appointing ministers that, as the Constitution disposes, I must sign, assuming the institutional responsibility.

In this case the President of the Republic plays a guarantee role, which has never suffered, nor can be subjected to, impositions.

I have shared and accepted all the proposals for ministers, except that of the Minister for the Economy.

The designation of the Minister of Economy is always an immediate message of trust or alarm for economic and financial operators.

For this ministry, I asked for an authoritative political exponent of the majority, consistent with the program agreement. An exponent who - beyond the esteem and the consideration for the person - is not seen as a supporter of a line, often manifested, that could provoke, probably, or even, inevitably, the Italians' escape from the euro. What is very different from a vigorous attitude, within the European Union, to change it for the better from the Italian point of view.

In response to my solicitation, I registered - with regret - unavailability of any other solution, and the appointed President of the Council has remitted the mandate.

Uncertainty over our position in the euro has alarmed investors and savers, both Italian and foreign, who have invested in our government bonds and in our companies. The surge in spread, day after day, increases our public debt and reduces the possibility of spending by the State for new social interventions.
The losses on the stock exchange, day after day, burn resources and savings of our companies and those who have invested. And they constitute real risks for the savings of our fellow citizens and for Italian families.

Attention must also be paid to the danger of large increases in mortgage interest, and for loans to companies. Many people remember when - before the European Monetary Union - bank interest was close to 20 percent.

It is my duty, in carrying out the task of appointing ministers - who entrusts the Constitution to me - to be attentive to the protection of the Italians' savings.

In this way, Italian sovereignty is reaffirmed concretely. While unacceptable and grotesque judgments on Italy, appeared on press organs of a European country, must be rejected.

Italy is a founding country of the European Union, and is its protagonist.

I do not make the affirmations tonight lightheartedly. Also because I have done everything possible to give birth to a political government.

In making these statements I put forward, in any other respect, the defense of the Constitution and of the interest of our national community.

That of joining the Euro is a choice of fundamental importance for the perspectives of our country and of our young people: if we want to discuss it we must do it openly and with serious consideration. Also because it is a topic that has not been in the foreground during the recent election campaign.

I have been informed of requests by political forces to go to close elections. This is a decision that I reserve to take, dutifully, on the basis of what will happen in Parliament.

In the next few hours I will take an initiative.",europe,t5_2qh4j,full speech of the president of the italian republic mattarella 27/05 (google translated),28

The article has a few interesting points on the past and future of the US-European political relations. 


*By Jemima Kelly*

INTL-FCStone macro strategist Vincent Deluard put out a fun piece Wednesday night suggesting investment strategies for the end of the “post-transatlantic” world, in which he argues America should pivot away from Europe towards “the continent that matters -- Asia”.

He says the “transatlantic divorce” will dampen demand for the dollar and therefore weaken it, and will lead to “much, much higher” Treasury yields, as a leaderless and less predictable world will mean US sovereign debt will no longer be seen as risk-free:

&gt;In the charitable (European) view, Europe is to Uncle Sam what Athens was to imperial Rom [sic], a respected source of inspiration and culture. In the realistic (American) view, Europe is to the U.S. what Robin is to Batman, a mostly useless sidekick to the one true superhero.
&gt;The U.S. no longer sees the value of its alliance with this cluster of whining, declining mid-size powers. 

Ouch.

But he also argues that Europe too should reorient itself away from America, as it “no longer needs an alliance that has repeatedly hurt [its] economic interests”. See for instance Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council who had harsh words for the US this week.

China has overtaken the US as Germany's biggest non-European trade partner, and US trade with Europe now accounts for just 6 per cent of the total (down from 10 per cent in 1960). And Mr Deluard tells us that the shrinkage of Europe’s American dependency will speed up due to “historical changes in trade routes” (80 per cent of which -- by volume -- are maritime):

&gt;Control of the oil tanker route eventually allowed allied powers to recover from their early defeats in World War 2. The United States protected this route with a pearl necklace of military bases and navy fleets. This supremacy has not been challenged since the Royal Navy retreated from the Suez Canal in 1956. The U.S.-controlled Europe-Middle East-Asia sea route was the pillar of the 20th century world order and the ultimate justification of the Transatlantic alliance.
&gt;This triple geopolitical constraint on European prosperity is progressively relaxing and may cease to exist by the middle of this century. 

That's because the traditional route -- across the Taiwan straits, the South China Sea, the strait of Malacca, the Gulf of Aden, the Suez Canal, and then the strait of Gibraltar -- is no longer the fastest way to send cargo ships from Northeast Asia to Europe. The Northern Sea Route, which is getting bigger, shaves about 30 per cent off the distance and avoids pirates. See the map below, from the report -- the NSR is in red, while the Suez route is in turquoise.
Quill Cloud

The reason this route is opening up is because the ice caps are melting:

&gt;For now, trade volume on the Northern Sea Route is a statistical error: just 18 ships crossed the Northern Sea Route last year, down from a peak of 71 in 2013. However, time and global warming play in the NSR’s favor: a 984-foot liquefied natural gas tanker crossed the NSR without the aid of specialized ice-breaking vessels for the first time last year. The Copenhagen Business School estimates that the Arctic liner shipping will become economically feasible around 2040 if the ice cover continues to diminish at the present rate. 

A warm Arctic isn't his main argument. China's “One Belt, One Road” policy, which aims to connect 75 per cent of the world’s population in 40 countries within a decade, and to reduce the land-travelling time from London to Beijing to two days -- is another reason to encourage what Mr Deluard calls “le divorce”, as well as Europe's shrinking depency on Middle Eastern oil.

Still, global warming, eh. It's not all bad. ",europe,t5_2qh4j,investment themes for a post-transatlantic world,2
